This program will take in two inputs,
1.) Starting station
2.) End station

And returns
1.) A printed set of directions which include,
1.a.) Name of lines to take
1.b.) To what what station do you ride said line
1.c.) Do you switch lines, and to which lines and in what directions


For each station, I need:
1.) Name
2.) Connected lines
3.) Next station on connected lines

Current status:
1.) I have almost all of the basics.
2.) The only issue is direction of lines and if I can possibly give those (i.e. do you go towards A or B for a given line C).
3.) I also have a working BFT graph search working, but it isn't very optimal and likes to switch lines often when it seems odd to."
4.) I wouldn't mind figuring out how to do a basic GUI for this.
