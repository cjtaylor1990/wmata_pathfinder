Current status:
1.) I have almost all of the basics.

2.) I have done a bit of optimization of the search algorithm, deciding to do a DFS rather than a BFS. This, combined with guaranteeing that the stations with the same line as the current line are put on the stack last (and thus pop first), biases the algorithm against switching lines, which is what you would want in a subway path searching tool.

Things to do:

1.) The only issue is direction of lines and if I can possibly give those (i.e. do you go towards A or B for a given line C). This is important given the fact that trains are labeled in their directions by their terminal destinations.

2.) I wouldn't mind figuring out how to do a basic GUI for this.
